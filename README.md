# OddOrEvenKata
 For this Kata challenge i had to determine if the sum of an array is odd or even. I then used the Nunit package package to create some unit tests!
 
 ## The description for the challenge is as follows:
 
### Task:
Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Output: "even"

Input: [0, 1, 4]
